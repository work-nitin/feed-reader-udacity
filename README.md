# Project Overview
Its a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.
# Steps to test the HTML and Javascript with Jasmine Testing Tool
I have included the various files and Js files which are provided by Udacity for the FEED READER PROJECT. I have updated the feedreader.js file with the test
which I would like to perform once the index.html file get invoke.

# Steps
Open the index.HTML and once Jasime is installed you should see the Jasmine test window at the bottom of your HTML once DOM is loaded fully.
Various tests for the RSS feeds are written in feedreader.js file which will be used to test the RSS Feeds Functionality for the various URL's.

 To install Jasmine standalone on your local box (where {#.#.#} below is substituted by the release number downloaded):

 Download the standalone distribution for your desired release from the releases page
Create a Jasmine directory in your project - mkdir my-project/jasmine
Move the dist to your project directory - mv jasmine/dist/jasmine-standalone-{#.#.#}.zip my-project/jasmine
Change directory - cd my-project/jasmine
Unzip the dist - unzip jasmine-standalone-{#.#.#}.zip
Add the following to your HTML file:

<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="jasmine/lib/jasmine-{#.#.#}/jasmine_favicon.png">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jasmine/lib/jasmine-{#.#.#}/jasmine.css">

<script type="text/javascript" src="jasmine/lib/jasmine-{#.#.#}/jasmine.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jasmine/lib/jasmine-{#.#.#}/jasmine-html.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jasmine/lib/jasmine-{#.#.#}/boot.js"></script>

## Why this Project?
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
